**Why are we doing this?**
- When you're working on your code on your own computer (in development), Flask's built-in server is great for testing. But when you want to make your application available to real users on the internet (in production), Flask’s built-in server isn’t powerful or secure enough. That’s why we use a more robust tool called Gunicorn.

**What is Gunicorn?**
- Gunicorn is a program that takes your Flask application and runs it in a way that’s safe and fast enough for the real world. Think of it as a better engine for your web app when it’s ready to go live.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Install Gunicorn**:
   - Just like you installed Flask, you need to install Gunicorn. You do this by typing a command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```
   - This command tells your computer to download and set up Gunicorn.

2. **Run Your Application with Gunicorn**:
   - After installing Gunicorn, you’ll use it to start your Flask app. Instead of running the app directly with Python, you’ll type this command:
   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 fake_insurance_api:app
   ```
   - Let’s break this down:
     - `gunicorn`: This tells your computer to use the Gunicorn program.
     - `--bind 0.0.0.0:8000`: This tells Gunicorn to listen for connections on all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`) on port 8000. Port 8000 is just a door through which users can access your app.
     - `fake_insurance_api:app`: This tells Gunicorn to look in the `fake_insurance_api.py` file and run the `app` inside it. `app` is the name of your Flask application object.

3. **Accessing Your Application**:
   - Once Gunicorn is running, your application will be live on `http://your-server-ip:8000/predict`.
   - If you’re just testing on your own computer, you can open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict` to see it in action.

### Why Use Gunicorn?
- **Security**: Gunicorn is better at handling the kinds of attacks that can happen when your app is on the internet.
- **Performance**: It can handle many more users at the same time than Flask’s built-in server.

### In Summary
When you’re ready to make your Flask app available to others (not just on your computer), you use Gunicorn to run it. This makes sure your app is fast and secure enough for real users.
